  <h1 id="on-my-values">On My Values</h1>
<p>Recently, I’ve learned about the importance of knowing your core values. Most people don’t look at what their values are. I used to be that.</p>
<p>If I’m not sure what I value, I drift from one thing to another according to what the world throws at me.</p>
<p>One of my mentors told me that to be a leader you should stand for something. You should have something that you value.</p>
<p>I thought I should spend some time to figure out my values. I used value sheets (list of values) which are present online to find out my core values.</p>
<p>These are my core values right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Health (mental and physical)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll tell you what these values mean to me.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong></p>
<p>Without health, it doesn’t matter what else you have.</p>
<p>“ A healthy man wants many things. A sick man only wants one thing”</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a relationship between your mind and body. Mental and physical health go hand in hand. For me, health is not worrying about diseases. Feeling awesome in my mood when I go through my day. Having a better life experience.</p>
<p><strong>Happiness</strong></p>
<p>Happiness is about finding your life meaningful. Even though there’s no inherent meaning to human life, we can create meaning in our individual lives. We can achieve this by being honest with ourselves. What do you enjoy? Whom do you admire?</p>
<p>Happiness is less dependent on what happens to you. It’s more about how you think about what happens to you. Having a growth mindset helps. Knowing that you can improve things, no matter the situation you’re in.</p>
<p><strong>Growth</strong></p>
<p>Growth is about improving at things that you care about. The human condition craves mastery. That’s why we admire a great artist, a rock star, and a good performance of any kind. We know that it’s difficult to do.</p>
<p>Growth is about using the resources around you to create something valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Fun</strong></p>
<p>Life is short. If you’re not having fun, you’re doing it wrong. It doesn’t matter what you build. This world will forget your name within a few years after you die. Even if it’s remembered, how does it matter to you? You’re in your deep sleep.</p>
<p>Fun is doing things for their own sake. Not for an external reward. To your surprise, it may let you find your purpose. Remember that no dead person has taken a single dime along with him.</p>
<p>Fun helps you stay with things for a long time. This helps you get compounding effects. Only through compounding, you&rsquo;ll achieve anything worthwhile. If it’s not fun, you’ll give up after some time.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom</strong></p>
<p>External circumstances shouldn&rsquo;t restrict me from doing something that I want to do.</p>
<p>We humans are social beings. We’ve to put up with some restrictions on individual freedom for collective freedom. But, those restrictions shouldn&rsquo;t stop me from doing things that I care about.</p>
<p>Not doing things that I don’t want to do. Saying “NO” to things that I don’t care about. So that I can say “YES” to things that I love.</p>
<p>This is my rant on my inner values. There are other values that I care about. But, these take the front seat.</p>
<p>Try figuring out your inner values. Why do you care about these values? This’ll help you make good decisions. Also, it’s fun.</p>
